	<h1>Expanded Preface</h1>
		
	<h2>Questioning Our Trash Habits</h2>
	<p>
		Most of us throw things away without a second thought. Trash disappears from our lives the moment we toss it into a bin, bound for recycling plants, donation centers, compost heaps, or landfills we’ll never see. But what if we paid closer attention to what we discard? What could our trash reveal about us involving our habits, our values, even our blind spots?</p>
	<h2>My Trash Journey</h2>
		<p>
		I started documenting my weekly waste as an experiment in self-awareness. I wanted to see not just what I was throwing away, but why. Was I being wasteful in ways I hadn’t considered? Could I make better choices about what I buy, use, and dispose of? By tracking my discarded items, I hoped to recognize patterns in my consumption and find opportunities for more sustainable habits.</p>
	<p>
		This project is also about storytelling. Every object we discard has a history, such as where it came from, how it was used, and why it was ultimately deemed unnecessary. By sharing these stories, I invite others to think more critically about their own waste. Maybe someone scrolling through my posts will notice something familiar and reflect on their own habits. Maybe they’ll share their thoughts, and we can start a conversation about sustainability, minimalism, or even the emotional weight of letting things go.</p>
	<h2>The Theory Behind Trash</h2>
		<p>
		But this project is also situated within a larger historical and archaeological context. <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/archaeologist-talks-trash"><c>As Sarah Newman suggests,</c></a>the concept of trash is not universal or timeless; it has evolved with modernity. She challenges the assumption that waste has always been associated with disposability or worthlessness. In discussing archaeology’s role in defining waste, she notes that “archaeologists usually deal with things that people have left behind because they are unwanted or useless. That may be true in some cases, but people also leave things behind that are valuable or serve a specific purpose (such as a burial or an offering)” (Lee). This perspective complicates our contemporary understanding of trash since what we discard today may serve as historical artifacts tomorrow, shaping how future societies interpret our present.</p>

		  </div>
	<p> 
		One striking difference between past and present waste is its material persistence. Unlike biodegradable remnants of earlier civilizations, much of what we throw away today such as plastics, synthetics, and chemically treated materials do not decompose. Newman dispels the myth that throwing items away makes them disappear, explaining that “as inhabitants of industrialized cities, we often think of landfills as places set apart for things to decay, deteriorate, and vanish, but in reality, landfills tend to offer ideal conditions for preservation” (Lee). Our waste lingers, accumulating in ways that challenge the illusion of disposability.</p>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/special-series/vik-muniz-brazil-garbage-art.html"><c>Artist Vik Muniz’s</c></a> series “Museum of Ashes” further complicates our understanding of what is discarded and destroyed. Muniz explored the transformation of objects through fire, capturing what they looked like before being turned to ash. His work resonates with the Trash of the Week project because it highlights how objects once deemed valuable can transition into a state of uselessness. This artistic perspective aligns with the intention of chronicling discarded items; not just as waste, but as artifacts of daily life, each with its own narrative arc. By preserving these moments before disposal, we cultivate a more thoughtful view of consumption, waste, and recyclability.</p>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/waste-9781628924381/"><c>Brian Thill's</c></a> exploration of waste in the digital age extends these ideas into the realm of digital detritus. Building on Calvino’s literary meditations on trash, Thill argues that waste is not just a physical problem but a digital one as well. Just as physical trash accumulates in landfills, digital detritus, such as obsolete files, abandoned social media profiles, forgotten emails, lingers in virtual spaces, consuming energy and shaping digital identities. Unlike physical waste, digital detritus is often invisible, yet it persists indefinitely, with no clear disposal mechanism. Thill suggests that some digital waste holds value, much like physical artifacts, offering personal or historical insight. An old Tumblr blog, for example, might seem like digital clutter, yet it can serve as an archive of past experiences, reflecting personal growth or broader cultural trends.</p>
	<p>
		Just as digital detritus can have unexpected significance, so too can physical waste. Objects that seem disposable like old letters, broken heirlooms, and outdated gadgets often carry sentimental or historical value. Like forgotten files on a hard drive, these items exist in a liminal space between trash and artifact, raising questions about what we choose to preserve and why. The Trash of the Week project engages with these tensions, treating waste as both a record of consumption and a site of potential meaning.</p>
	<h2>The Artistic Angle of it All</h2>
		<p>
		In addition to these perspectives, contemporary artists are actively transforming waste into art to raise environmental awareness. For instance, <a href="https://planetdetroit.org/2024/04/waste-reimagined-artists-trash-art/"><c>Detroit-based artist Halima Cassells</c></a> collaborates with local communities to repurpose trash collected from the Rouge River into public art installations. Through workshops and participatory projects, Cassells engages volunteers in cleaning natural spaces and creatively reimagining the gathered debris. This process not only beautifies communal areas but also fosters a collective consciousness about consumption and waste. </p>
	<p>
		Similarly, artist Hannah Tizedes has amassed over 100,000 small plastic pieces from various cleanups across Michigan. She incorporates these fragments into her artwork, highlighting the pervasive issue of plastic pollution in the Great Lakes. By transforming discarded materials into visual narratives, Tizedes emphasizes the tangible impact of our consumption habits on the environment.</p>
	<h2>Touching on Waste Management</h2>
	<p>
		In exploring the multifaceted nature of waste, it's essential to consider not only personal habits and cultural perceptions but also the technological advancements shaping waste management today. The article <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/15/8847"><c>"Modern Technologies for Waste Management: A Review"</c></a> highlights how contemporary solutions have transformed waste management practices, emphasizing the role of the Internet and social media in enhancing ecological awareness. These platforms enable scientists and environmentalists to disseminate information widely, fostering a global dialogue on sustainability and responsible consumption.</p>
	<div class="center">
	<img src="images/management.jpg" alt="image of waste management plant">
	<p><d>A waste management plant, the place a lot of human waste ends up.</d></p>
		</div>
		<p>
		This technological perspective complements the personal and artistic dimensions of the Trash of the Week project. While individual efforts to document and reflect on waste contribute to self-awareness and cultural critique, modern technologies provide the tools and platforms necessary for broader societal impact. By leveraging these advancements, we can transform personal insights into collective action, promoting sustainable practices and redefining our relationship with waste on a global scale.</p>
	<h2>My Role in Collecting Trash</h2>
		<p>
		In this way, Trash of the Week is not just a personal exploration but also a reflection on modernity’s relationship with waste. Newman would likely find value in this project as a contemporary record of what we deem disposable, contrasting it with past societies where waste had different meanings and functions. Similarly, Muniz’s work underscores the importance of recognizing an object’s transition from use to obsolescence. Thill’s insights on digital detritus further complicate the conversation, expanding the notion of waste beyond the material to include the intangible traces we leave behind. By making trash visible both in a personal and historical sense I hope to complicate the way we think about what we throw away, fostering a dialogue about consumption, responsibility, and the legacies we leave behind.</p>
