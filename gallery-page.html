			<p>New York and New Jersey are home to many horror films. From Bride of Chucky to Friday the 13th, these movies are what make the Northeast feel like home. It's always fun to watch movies and point at the screen, thinking "Hey, I know that place!" and it's even more fun when there is a goofy-looking killer on the loose in the local neighborhood. I am setting off to chase that feeling and possibly reveal some scary locations that you didn't know took place in the Empire State and Garden State. </p>

				<h3>Isolated Environments</h3>

				<!-- page preview image -->

				<a href=""><img src="finalImgs/amityville img3.jpg" alt="Representative preview image (not a screenshot)"></a>

				<p>These films are located in very rural, closed-off areas that add to the creepiness of being alone. States that are full of bustling cities like New York and New Jersey do indeed have rural farm areas!</p>
