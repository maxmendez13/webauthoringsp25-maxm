				<p>My name is Nica and I am the lead writer. I have spent years recording all of the horror spots local to New York and New Jersey. I've been from Brick to Brooklyn, from Poughkeepsie to Passaic searching for the sets of slashers and other horror movies...and sometimes the horrors find me. I will continue to document these frightful areas before the evils eventually claim me.</p>

				<a href=""><img src="finalImgs/jesse.png" alt="Jesse"></a>

				<p>These films are located in very rural, closed-off areas that add to the creepiness of being alone. States that are full of bustling cities like New York and New Jersey do indeed have rural farm areas!</p>
